Three terms : Iterable, Iterator, Generator

Iterable : Object that can be looped over. Must have the __iter__(self) method
eg. lists are iterables but not iterators

__iter__ : It must return an object that has __iter__ and __next implemented




Iterators : Iterator is an object with a state that remembers where it is while iteration. 
            It must have __iter__, __next__ methods implemented

__iter__ : It must return itself
__next__ : stores current stage of iteration and returns value. raises StopIteration exception when end is reached.

note : Iterators are also iterables but reverse is not always true


for loop behaviour:
eg.         for obj in objlist:

here forloop calls iter(objlist)-> gives iterator for that iter_object
                   next(iter_object) calls repeatedly untill end
